				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>
					WASD symbolizes several key beliefs: unity,
					strength, ambition, and perseverance. These are
					fundamental attributes of life inside and outside
					of gaming. You need them all to win. Leading the
					pack, WASD is gaming, defined.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since 1999, WASD has been delivering on its
					promise to build the best gaming systems for the
					most discerning gamers. Even in a time when PCs
					were not as ubiquitous as they are today, we
					fueled the passion for gaming by giving our
					customers the highest quality in custom built
					computers. Our systems have since become the
					backbone for professional gamers, game developers,
					LAN centers, major esports tournaments, and every
					day consumers.
				</p>
				<p>
					WASD has worked intimately with brands such as
					Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Microsoft, Western Digital,
					Asus, Bethesda, MLG, and many more. Superior
					performance, reliability, cutting edge technology,
					and timely production make WASD the authority in
					PC gaming.
